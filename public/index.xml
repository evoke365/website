      <description>The following curve is called the Forgetting Curve. It hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in time and shows how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it. Humans tend to halve their memory of newly learned knowledge in a matter of days or weeks unless they consciously review the learned material.
From 1880 to 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus carried out a series of well-designed experiments to investigate the rate of forgetting.</description>
