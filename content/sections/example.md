The following curve is called the [Forgetting Curve](https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/curve-forgetting). It hypothesizes the decline of memory retention in time and shows how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it. Humans tend to halve their memory of newly learned knowledge in a matter of days or weeks unless they consciously review the learned material.

From 1880 to 1885, [Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus) carried out a series of well-designed experiments to investigate the rate of forgetting. In the publication of his hypothesis he included an equation to approximate his forgetting curve.

Here, b represents 'Savings' expressed as a percentage, and t represents time in minutes. Savings is defined as the relative amount of time saved on the second learning trial as a result of having had the first. A savings of 100% would indicate that all items were still known from the first trial. A 75% savings would mean that relearning missed items required 25% as long as the original learning session (to learn all items). 'Savings' is thus, analogous to retention rate.

In 2015, an attempt to replicate the forgetting curve with one study subject has shown the [experimental results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4492928/) similar to Ebbinghaus' original data.

In Ebbinghaus's research, he asserted that the best methods for increasing the strength of memory are:

1 - better memory representation

2 - repetition based on active recall

His premise was that each repetition in learning increases the optimum interval before the next repetition is needed (for near-perfect retention, initial repetitions may need to be made within days, but later they can be made after years). 

The following diagram demonstrates the Forgetting Curve with Spaced Repetition.
