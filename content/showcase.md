It takes 2 steps to remember everything:

Step 1 - take notes

It takes a few seconds to note down something in your Studybox such as vocabularies, phrases, concepts etc. Anything you want to remember.

Step 2 - get reminded

After your note are added to Studybox, a revision schedule will be created. Your notes will be sent to your email inbox just before you are about to forget them.
